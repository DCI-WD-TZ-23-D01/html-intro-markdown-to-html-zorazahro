    <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        It was brillig, and the slithy toves <br />
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br />
        All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
        And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
        <br>

        <q>Beware the <b>Jabberwock</b>, my son!<br />
        The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
        Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
        The frumious Bandersnatch!</q><br />
        <br>

        He took his vorpal sword in hand.<br />
        Long time the manxome foe he sought-<br />
        So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
        And stood awhile in thought.<br />
        <br>

        And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
        The <b>Jabberwock</b>, with eyes of flame,<br />
        Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
        And burbled as it came!<br />
        <br>

        One, two! And through and through<br />
        The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
        He left it dead, and with its head<br />
        He went galumphing back.<br />
        <br>

        <q>And hast thou slain the <b>Jabberwock</b>?<br />
        Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
        O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!</q><br />
        He chortled in his joy.<br />
        <br>

        It was brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br />
        All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
        And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
